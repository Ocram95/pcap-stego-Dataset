# pcap-stego-Dataset

This repository contains the information to identify the flows containing the covert channels and the transmitted attacks for the dataset in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1viO6NwnY2cHO6sl7-JFI8YaN4LCgd9Lq?usp=sharing).


In particular:

- flows: this directory contains the csv files with all the information necessary 
to identify the flows containing the covert channels as well as the transmitted attacks (for both file traces)

- attacks: this directory lists the attacks used to create storage and timing covert channels 
(i.e., 29 fileless commands, 30 powershell scripts, and 100 malicious URLS)
